  <h1 style ="color:green;">THE ULTIMATE GUIDE TO COVID-19 </br> Today we are answering 25 of the most commonly asked questions about COVID-19</h1>
  <h2><p style="color:red;">what is coronavirus? </p></h2>
 <h2><p style="color:blue;">The COVID-19 pandemic, also known as the coronavirus pandemic, is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)</p></h2>
  <h2><p style="color:red;">where did it start? </p></h2>
  <h2><p style="color:blue;">It was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. </p></h2>
  <h2><p style="color:red;">when did it start? </p></h2>
<h2><p style="color:blue;">December 2019  </p></h2>
  <h2><p style="color:red;">what are its symptoms?  </p></h2>
  <h2><p style="color:blue;"> symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, breathing difficulties, and loss of smell and taste. Symptoms begin one to fourteen days after exposure to the virus. Of those people who develop noticeable symptoms, most (81%) develop mild to moderate symptoms (up to mild pneumonia), while 14% develop severe symptoms (dyspnea, hypoxia, or more than 50% lung involvement on imaging), and 5% suffer critical symptoms (respiratory failure, shock, or multiorgan dysfunction).[9] Older people are more likely to have severe symptoms. At least a third of the people who are infected with the virus remain asymptomatic and do not develop noticeable symptoms at any point in time, but they still can spread the disease.[10][11] Around 20% of those people will remain asymptomatic throughout infection, and the rest will develop symptoms later on, becoming pre-symptomatic rather than asymptomatic </p></h2>
<h2><p style="color:red;">how do i protect myself from it? </p></h2>
<h2><p style="color:blue;">To prevent the spread of COVID-19:</br>
1. Clean your hands often. Use soap and water, or an alcohol-based hand rub.</br>
2. Maintain a safe distance from anyone who is coughing or sneezing.</br>
3. Wear a mask when physical distancing is not possible.</br>
4. Don’t touch your eyes, nose or mouth.</br>
5. Cover your nose and mouth with your bent elbow or a tissue when you cough or sneeze.</br>
6. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention.</br> </p></h2>
<h2><p style="color:red;">what is the FDA(food and drug administration) doing in response to COVID-19  </p></h2>
<h2><p style="color:blue;"><h2><p style="color:blue;">The FDA, along with other federal, state, and local agencies and public health officials across the country and internationally, plays a critical role in protecting public health during the COVID-19 pandemic. FDA staff are working around the clock to support development of  medical countermeasures and are providing regulatory advice, guidance, and technical assistance to advance the development and availability of vaccines, therapies, diagnostic tests and other medical devices for use diagnosing, treating, and preventing this novel virus. The FDA continues to monitor the human and animal food supply and take swift action on fraudulent COVID-19 products.
<h2><p style="color:red;">How does COVID 19 spread</p></h2>
<h2><p style="color:blue;">COVID-19 is spread through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes or speaks. People can also be infected by touching a contaminated surface and then their eyes, mouth or nose.
<h2><p style="color:red;">how long does COVID-19 last? </p></h2>
<h2><p style="color:blue;">Some early studies suggest between 1 in 5 and 1 in 10 people with COVID-19 will experience symptoms lasting longer than a month. A majority of those who were admitted to hospital with severe disease report long-term problems including fatigue and shortness of breath.
<h2><p style="color:red;">can COVID-19 survive in water? </p></h2>
<h2><p style="color:blue;">currently there is no evidence about survival of COVID-19 in drinking water or sewage water
<h2><p style="color:red;">who is at risk from coronavirus? </p></h2>
<h2><p style="color:blue;">The virus that causes COVID-19 infects people of all ages. However, evidence to date suggests that two groups of people are at a higher risk of getting severe COVID-19 disease. These are older people (that is people over 60 years old); and those with underlying medical conditions (such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer). The risk of severe disease gradually increases with age starting from around 40 years. It's important that adults in this age range protect themselves and in turn protect others that may be more vulnerable.
WHO has issued advice for these two groups and for community support to ensure that they are protected from COVID-19 without being isolated, stigmatized, left in a position of increased vulnerability or unable to access basic provisions and social care.
<h2><p style="color:red;">how dangerous is COVID-19?</p></h2>
<h2><p style="color:blue;">Although for most people COVID-19 causes only mild illness, it can make some people very ill. More rarely, the disease can be fatal. Older people, and those with pre- existing medical conditions (such as high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes) appear to be more vulnerable.
<h2><p style="color:red;">can COVID-19 be transimitted between humans and animals? </p></h2>
<h2><p style="color:blue;"> Available evidence suggests that the virus is predominantly transmitted between people through respiratory droplets and close contact, but there are also examples of transmission between humans and animals. Several animals that have been in contact with infected humans, such as minks, dogs, domestic cats, lions and tigers, have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. </p></h2>
<h2><p style="color:red;">can COVID-19 travel between hot and humid climates?</p></h2>
<h2><p style="color:blue;">Yes,it can </p></h2>
<h2><p style="color:red;">does heat prevent COVID-19?</p></h2>
<h2><p style="color:blue;">Exposing yourself to the sun or temperatures higher than 25°C DOES NOT protect you from COVID-19. You can catch COVID-19, no matter how sunny or hot the weather is. Countries with hot weather have reported cases of COVID-19. </p></h2>
<h2><p style="color:red;">what are the best things to eat during this pandemic?</p></h2>
<h2><p style="color:blue;">Promote diets which are based on a variety of unprocessed or minimally processed foods, include wholegrains, legumes, nuts and an abundance and variety of fruits and vegetables and which can include moderate amounts of eggs, dairy, poultry and fish, and small amounts of red meat </p></h2>
<h2><p style="color:red;">what are the effects of COVID-19 on mental health?</p></h2>
<h2><p style="color:blue;">Bereavement, isolation, loss of income and fear are triggering mental health conditions or exacerbating existing ones. Many people may be facing increased levels of alcohol and drug use, insomnia, and anxiety.
Meanwhile, COVID-19 itself can lead to neurological and mental complications, such as delirium, agitation, and stroke. People with pre-existing mental, neurological or substance use disorders are also more vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection ̶ they may stand a higher risk of severe outcomes and even death </p></h2>
<h2><p style="color:red;">how can i reduce stress during the COVID-19?</p></h2>
<h2><p style="color:blue;">Take up a relaxation practice. When stressors throw your nervous system out of balance, relaxation techniques such as deep breathing, meditation, and yoga can bring you back into a state of equilibrium. Regular practice delivers the greatest benefits, so see if you can set aside even a little time every day.</p></h2>
<h2><p style="color:red;">what is the risk of dying for the older people?</p></h2>
<h2><p style="color:blue;">Over 95% of these deaths occurred in those older than 60 years.

More than 50% of all fatalities involved people aged 80 years or older. Reports show that 8 out of 10 deaths are occurring in individuals with at least one comorbidity, in particular those with cardiovascular disease, hypertension and diabetes, but also with a range of other chronic underlying conditions. </p></h2>

<h2><p style="color:red;">why are older people at higher risk for COVID-19?</p></h2>
<h2><p style="color:blue;"> Although all age groups are at risk of contracting COVID-19, older people face significant risk of developing severe illness if they contract the disease due to physiological changes that come with ageing and potential underlying health conditions</p></h2>
<h2><p style="color:red;">what is the treatment for COVID-19?</p></h2>
<h2><p style="color:blue;">for more than 11 months there was no treatment for it,however many vaccines have been recently developed out of which few have shown succesful results </p></h2>

<h2><p style="color:red;">can cold weather or snow prevent COVID-19?</p></h2>
<h2><p style="color:blue;">NO , it CANT </p></h2>

<h2><p style="color:red;">which vaccine is being used in india?</p></h2>
<h2><p style="color:blue;">Manufactured in India by the Serum Institute of India (SII), the Oxford vaccine is one of the two vaccines being used in India currently, the other being Covaxin made by domestic company Bharat Biotech. </p></h2>

<h2><p style="color:red;">why are 2 vaccine doses needed?</p></h2>
<h2><p style="color:blue;">When the vaccines were first tested, a relatively weak immune reaction was found within a few weeks after people received the first dose of vaccine, followed by a strong reaction when a second dose was given. </p></h2>

<h2><p style="color:red;">Are there special precautions for giving the covid 19 vaccine?</p></h2>
<h2><p style="color:blue;">Special precautions: Vaccine should be administered with caution in persons with history of any bleeding or coagulation disorder (e.g., clotting factor deficiency, coagulopathy or platelet disorder). </p></h2>

<h2><p style="color:red;">do i have to wear mask after vaccination?</p></h2>
<h2><p style="color:blue;">But vaccinated people may still carry enough virus in the nose to infect others. So if a vaccinated person breathes or sneezes they could still infect someone else, even if they feel fine. This means vaccinated people still have to wear masks and socially distance, even if their individual risk is much lower </p></h2>
